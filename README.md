FoundryVTT module for the PF2e system, which replaces hero points for a Stress value. Stress can be used in campaigns where PCs face being ground down by factors over long periods of time.

Each character has a stress value ranging from 0 - 10. When they perform an action that requires them to take stress, the stress value is increased by one.

When a character reaches 10 stress they take a Trauma which is a negative condition that can only be removed by long term recovery.

## Features
- Replaces Hero Point pips on the Character Sheet with a Stress value
- Current Stress value of all characters can be seen on the Party sheet
- Context menu to reroll using a point of stress

## limitations
- No automation for increasing the stress value based on events such as a character being reduced to 0 hit points.
- No mechanism to apply Trauma conditions
