FoundryVTT module for the PF2e system, which replaces hero points for a Stress value. Stress can be used in campaigns where PCs face being ground down by factors over long periods of time.

Each character has a stress value beginning at 0. When they perform an action that requires them to take stress, the stress value is increased by one.

When a character reaches 10 stress they take a Trauma which is a negative condition that can only be removed by long term recovery.
